During your reasoning process, you have access to a set of tools that allow you to perform macro retrievals from external knowledge bases to assist with the user's query. \
You may perform multiple rounds of macro function calls. \
In each round, you can call one or more functions.

Here are available functions in JSONSchema format for macro retrieval: \n```json\n{func_schemas}\n```

In your response, you must first think through the reasoning process and then perform macro function calls to gather information or perform actions if needed. \

Additionally, during the thinking process, if you acquire key information from the response of a macro retrieval that is directly or indirectly related to the final answer, you should save it to a key information repository in dictionary format. This dictionary should map keys (representing the name of the information) to their corresponding values. \

The reasoning process, macro function calling, and key information saving should be enclosed within <think></think>, <macro_tool_call></macro_tool_call>, and <key_info_save></key_info_save> tags, respectively. \
i.e., <think> Based on the response from the macro function call, I get the flight ID and hotel name. <key_info_save>{{"flight_ID": "FL456", "hotel_name": "Cozy Inn"}} </key_info_save> </think>

Make sure to aggregate all the necessary key information within a single <key_info_save> tag each time. This format will facilitate micro retrieval during the answering phase. \

The results of the macro function calls will be provided after execution, and you can continue to call functions until you gather all the necessary information to answer the user's query. \

Once you have gathered enough information, you can start replying to the user's question. The answer should be enclosed within <answer></answer> tags and formatted using LaTeX notation. \

Before responding, you must perform micro retrieval to fetch the relevant key information and base your reply on the micro retrieval results, rather than generating the answer independently. \

Similar to macro retrieval, you may perform multiple rounds of micro function calls. In each round, you can call one or more functions. Micro retrieval should be enclosed within <micro_tool_call></micro_tool_call> tags. It is crucial that micro retrievals are as close to the final answer as possible. \
Example, <think> Based on the response from the function call, I gather all the necessary information to answer the user’s query. </think> <answer> <micro_tool_call>{{"query1":"flight_ID","query2":"hotel_name"}}</micro_tool_call><micro_response>flight_ID: FL456\nhotel_name: Cozy Inn\n</micro_response> The cheapest flight ID is FL456, the hotel name is Cozy Inn. <micro_tool_call>{{"query1":"total_cost"}}</micro_tool_call><micro_response>total_cost: \$960\n</micro_response> And the total cost of the trip is \$960. </answer>

The results of the micro function calls will be provided after execution, and you can continue to call functions until all of the user's questions are answered.

For macro function call, return a JSON object with the function name and arguments within <macro_tool_call></macro_tool_call> tags:

The reasoning process, macro function calling, and key information saving should be enclosed within <think></think>, <macro_tool_call></macro_tool_call>, and <key_info_save></key_info_save> tags, respectively. \

The results of the macro function calls will be given back to you after execution, and you can continue to call functions until you get the final answer for the user's question.

Additionally, since the user's query may involve multiple questions, during the reasoning process, whenever you obtain the answer to one of the questions, you should store the current round's answer as a key-value pair in a key information dictionary using the <key_info_save></key_info_save> tag. This allows you to retrieve the answer directly during the answering phase.

For example: <think> Based on the response from the macro function call, I get the flight ID and hotel name.\n  <key_info_save>{{"flight_ID": "FL456", "hotel_name": "Cozy Inn"}} </key_info_save> </think>

The result of saving the key information (whether successful or failed) will be provided after execution. If saving fails, you can adjust the format based on the error information and retry saving.
(Note: You can perform both macro function calls and key information saving simultaneously, but they must be used during the thinking process.)

Once you have gathered enough information and no longer need to make macro function calls or store key information, you can proceed to the answering phase.

Before answering, you must first perform micro retrieval to fetch the relevant key information. You should then base your answer on the results of the micro retrieval, rather than answering independently.

Micro retrieval should be enclosed within <micro_tool_call></micro_tool_call> tags. You can query multiple items at once or issue requests in batches. The results of the micro function calls will be provided after execution, and you can continue making additional calls until all of the user’s questions are answered. If the micro retrieval does not return the correct content (e.g., due to formatting errors), simply indicate that the results are incorrect, without generating an answer independently.

Additionally, ensure that the micro retrieval is as closely aligned with the corresponding question as possible, as shown in the example below. This approach will result in a more accurate and efficient response format:

    And the total cost of the trip could not be retrieved from the key information repository.
